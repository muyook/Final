            <article>At a local art gallery in 2010, amid the loud chatter over wine and cheese, I heard a weird metronomic sound over toward one wall. I wandered over to find a hammer set to tap relentlessly on a sheet of glass, behind which were these words in red letters: “BREAK GLASS IN CASE OF EMERGENCY.”</article><br>

            <p>Tap…. Tap…. Tap….</p>

            <p>The chatter and laughter continued unabated.</p>

            <article>Long-time readers here may recall what the artist, John Allen, said when I asked him about it. He explained that he had originally set the piece up in his home to test whether it could both get under one’s skin and also fade into the background.</article> <br>

            <article>The sculpture came to mind again this week when Anthony Leiserowitz, a Yale University researcher leading a longstanding effort to understand attitudes on global warming, distributed a note asking, “Is There a Climate ‘Spiral of Silence’ in America?” He summarized a fresh analysis by a team at Yale and George Mason University showing that while most Americans say they are somewhat or very interested in global warming, a bigger majority say they rarely or never talk about it.</article> <br>

            <p>Here's the data:</p>

            <article>It’s notable that this report comes shortly after climate researchers concluded that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have passed the 400 parts per million threshold in a way that’s essentially permanent — barring some extraordinary breakthrough in technologies capable of sopping up the gas for safekeeping — at the scale of billions of tons a year. (I wrote about this inevitable moment last year.)</article>

            <article>"Brief excursions towards lower values are still possible but it already seems safe to conclude that we won’t be seeing a monthly value below 400 ppm this year –  or ever again for the indefinite future."</article>

            <article> Another climate change milestone accrues, to go with the latest record highs in global temperature, and a new analysis putting recent warming in the context of 2 million years of climate history.</article><br>

            <p>As Randy Olson asserted years ago, could it be that the end of the world as we know it is simply “bo-ho-ho-ring”?</p>

            <p>In his note about the new analysis, Leiserowitz included an appeal for the public to weigh in:</p>

            <article id="quote">"Our findings suggest that there is a climate change “spiral of silence,” in which even people who care about the issue, shy away from discussing it because they so infrequently hear other people talking about it – reinforcing the spiral.  We’ve synthesized these findings in our latest Climate Note – read it <a src href="http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-spiral-silence-america/here">here</a>.</article><br>

            <article>What do you think? Do you think there a spiral of silence about climate change in America? Do you find yourself or others you know hesitant to talk about it? If so, why?</article><br>

            <p>So what’s to be done about what I once called “global waffling“?<p>

            <article>Ask George Marshall, the longtime climate campaigner, student of behavioral and social science and author of the most sobering and essential book on the issue: “Don’t Even Think About It: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Ignore Climate.”</article>

            <p>This is in synch with my notion of “Anthropophilia.”</p>
